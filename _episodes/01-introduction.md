Vectorisation in Python is a programming style where operations on a single piece of data, typically in a loop, are replaced by operations on entire arrays. Vectorisation can improve the performance of a code and can make the code more concise and easier to maintain.

In scripting languages, loops can be slow to execute because of the overhead of the interpreter, which may need to parse each expression, perform various input data checks and more. These overheads add up when expressions are repeated many times in a loop. Vectorisation avoids the issue by replacing the loop with a single array operation, which can significantly boost performance.
